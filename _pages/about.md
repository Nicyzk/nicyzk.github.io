## 👤 About Me
I'm a M.S.E. in Computer Science student at Princeton University, where I'm interested in systems for machine learning. Prior to this, I completed my B.A. in CS and Math at Columbia University. You can find my full resume <a href="/files/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

## 🏢 Work Experience

I was a full-stack software engineering intern at Infinitus Systems under the Kleiner Perkins Fellowship. I built a semantic search model for internal document search using Python, Go, Gemini, and React.

## 📚 Teaching Experience
I enjoy teaching, and being a mentor to students! Here's a list of courses that I've previously taught:
- Computer Networks @ Columbia University, Fall 2024
- Operating Systems @ Columbia University, Spring 2025
- Intro to Programming Systems @ Princeton University, Fall 2025

## 🧑‍🏫 Research Experience

### Rorke Black-box Microsecond-scale VM Scheduling
I contributed by writing some scheduler baselines, and designing database workloads in C++, Virsh, QEMU, Python

## 💻 Projects

### High Performance ML Class Project @ Columbia
We integrated Mamba2 into <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10211" target="_blank">HiSS</a>, and evaluated efficiency and MSE loss under different model hierarchy combinations and chunk sizes.

![LEANN Diagram](/images/leann.png){: .align-right height="20%" width="20%"}
### Advanced Computer Systems Class Project @ Princeton (In Progress)
Replicating <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08276" target="_blank">LEANN</a> - a low-storage vector search framework for edge devices  - in C++ by forking FAISS HNSW, and re-implementing 2-level search and high-diversity pruning algorithm from the paper. Will update with a blog post soon.
