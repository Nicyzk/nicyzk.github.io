## About Me
I'm a CS master's student at Princeton University, currently working with Prof. Tri Dao and Prof. Jialin Ding. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's in CS and Math at Columbia University.

## Research Interests
I'm interested in systems for ML, in particular:
- Low-level kernel optimization for ML
- Workload-aware vector search indexes

## Work Experience

I was a full-stack software engineering intern at Infinitus Systems under the Kleiner Perkins Fellowship. I built a semantic search model for internal document search using Python, Go, Gemini, and React.

## Research Experience

### Rorke Black-box Microsecond-scale VM Scheduling
I contributed by writing some scheduler baselines, and designing database workloads in C++, Virsh, QEMU, Python

## Teaching Experience
I enjoy teaching, and being a mentor to students! Here's a list of courses that I've previously taught:
- Computer Networks @ Columbia University, Fall 2024
- Operating Systems @ Columbia University, Spring 2025
- Intro to Programming Systems @ Princeton University, Fall 2025

## Projects

### High Performance ML Class Project @ Columbia
We integrated Mamba2 into <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10211" target="_blank">HiSS</a>, and evaluated efficiency and MSE loss under different model hierarchy combinations and chunk sizes.

### Advanced Computer Systems Class Project @ Princeton (In Progress)
Replicating <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08276" target="_blank">LEANN</a> \(a low-storage vector search framework for edge devices\) in C++ by forking FAISS HNSW, and re-implementing 2-level search and high-diversity pruning algorithm from the paper. Will update with a blog post soon.
